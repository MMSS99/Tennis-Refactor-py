Refactoring exercise based on [Emily Banche's Tennis Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata)

## Refactoring commits
Instead of displaying each commit and changes in the README, each commit has a description in which the precise changes that have ocurred are briefly explained. The scope is described by conventional commits and the branch where it was originaly commited to.
